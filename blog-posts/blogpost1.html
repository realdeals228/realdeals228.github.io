<h3>Why is this one of your favorite sites?</h3>
Good aggregation of all the sports news and scores that I am interested in. Easy to navigate and customize.
What area of the site is your eye drawn to when looking at the homepage? Stand back further, what area is your eye drawn to now? Is that area the most important area of the site?</h3>
The first thing I see on the site is the large video player in the middle of the screen because it is large and rotates through several different video stories. The next thing I notice is the scoreboard at the top. The most imporant part is probably the article list to the right of the video player which has all of the news stories for the day.
<h3>How would you describe the website visually? List 5 adjectives. (i.e. "pretty", "elegant", "simple", "dark", "cluttered", "basic" etc)</h3>
<li>Cluttered</li>
<li>Bold</li>
<li>Image Heavy</li>
<li>Colorful</li>
<li>Dynamic</li>
<h3>What problem does this website solve? What content does it have?</h3>
ESPN has news for all sports and  scores andvideo highlights of the nights games. 
What 5 adjectives would you use to describe the content, focus, and purpose of the site? (i.e. "practical", "fun", "whimsical", "silly", "serious" etc) How does that compare to the adjectives you used to describe the site visually?
<ul><li>Fun</li>
<li>Practical</li>
<li>Concise</li>
<li>Silly</li>
<li>Informitive</li></ul>
The site looks more serious than the content dictates, although it is possible that some fans consider sports to be more serious than I do.
<h3>How easy is it to find what you are looking for from the homepage? How about from another page?</h3>
Most of the news and score that you would look for are easy to find. However, as you get deeper into the site it becomes a bit harder and less intuitive to navigate.
<h3>How easy is it to browse through all the content of the site?</h3>
The site is very good for browsing because the videos and short articles are easy to digest quickly.
<h3>How do you feel after being on the site for a while? (i.e. "bored", "happy", "anxious or hyper", "like I wasted a lot of time" etc)</h3>
Content, I get my fill and then I am done. It's just a daily checkup on the last nights games.
<h3>Does the site sell anything? If so, have you purchased any of it? Why or why not?</h3>
It does sell memberships for "insider" and I have purchased that to get access to better statistics.

<h2>Twitch</h2>
<h3>Why is this one of your favorite sites?</h3>
It gives me access to all of the video game streams I watch.
<h3>What area of the site is your eye drawn to when looking at the homepage? Stand back further, what area is your eye drawn to now? Is that area the most important area of the site?</h3>
The large featured stream is the biggest hight draw, next would be the list of "Featured Games" that is just below the fold. That area is probably the most important area of the site.
How would you describe the website visually? List 5 adjectives. (i.e. "pretty", "elegant", "simple", "dark", "cluttered", "basic" etc)
<ul><li>Basic</li>
<li>White Space</li>
<li>Media Heavy</li>
<li>Little Colored</li>
<li>Aligned</li></ul>
<h3>What problem does this website solve? What content does it have?</h3>
The content is video game streams and twitch provides one of the only large platforms at the moment for this type of content
<h3>What 5 adjectives would you use to describe the content, focus, and purpose of the site? (i.e. "practical", "fun", "whimsical", "silly", "serious" etc) How does that compare to the adjectives you used to describe the site visually?</h3>
<ul><li>Fun</li>
<li>Silly</li>
<li>Entertaining</li>
<li>Background noise</li>
<li>Relaxing</li></ul>
The site's look is very media heavy which matches the tone of the entirely video content and its use as background TV for my internet browsing.
<h3>How easy is it to find what you are looking for from the homepage? How about from another page?</h3>
It is very easy to find a game or streams because of the favorites list and search bar on every page.
<h3>How easy is it to browse through all the content of the site?</h3>
The site is well set up for browsing all the streams of a particular game.
How do you feel after being on the site for a while? (i.e. "bored", "happy", "anxious or hyper", "like I wasted a lot of time" etc)
"like I wasted a lot of time" . Twitch is like reality TV crossed with video games so it definitely can feel like a time waste.
<h3>Does the site sell anything? If so, have you purchased any of it? Why or why not?</h3>
It sells "Turbo" to remove adds but I have not purchased that.

<h2>ChannelFireball</h2>
<h3>Why is this one of your favorite sites?</h3>
I play MTG and this is one of the best sites for strategy content related to the game
What area of the site is your eye drawn to when looking at the homepage? Stand back further, what area is your eye drawn to now? Is that area the most important area of the site?
The rotating promo box in the middle draws the eye at first followed by the Deal of the Day box. Since I don't buy cards from this site the strategy videos are more important to me than these other sections even though it is less visible.
<h3>How would you describe the website visually? List 5 adjectives. (i.e. "pretty", "elegant", "simple", "dark", "cluttered", "basic" etc)</h3>
<ul><li>Cluttered</li>
<li>Dull Colors</li>
<li>Busy</li>
<li>Large</li>
<li>Ad Heavy</li></ul>
<h3>What problem does this website solve? What content does it have?</h3>
The content is strategy articles and videos by many of the top players, it helps keep up to date on changes in the metagame.
What 5 adjectives would you use to describe the content, focus, and purpose of the site? (i.e. "practical", "fun", "whimsical", "silly", "serious" etc) How does that compare to the adjectives you used to describe the site visually?
<ul><li>Practical</li>
<li>Informitive</li>
<li>Educational</li>
<li>Fun</li>
<li>Digestable</li></ul>
The design of the site is focued on pushing card sales but the main content is strategy related and is usually absorbed as a video either full screen or on youtube which takes away from the design of the site.
<h3>How easy is it to find what you are looking for from the homepage? How about from another page?</h3>
Looking for content is rather difficult and the search bar is rather poor. The site seems to want to only show card deals rather than push content, likely because they don't monitize their content other than as a draw for the site's shop.
<h3>How easy is it to browse through all the content of the site?</h3>
It is easy enought to read the new articles and videos everyday if you know where to look but it is all below the fold and rather visually boring as you browse the site.
<h3>How do you feel after being on the site for a while? (i.e. "bored", "happy", "anxious or hyper", "like I wasted a lot of time" etc)</h3>
Informed and entertained.
<h3>Does the site sell anything? If so, have you purchased any of it? Why or why not?</h3>
It sells cards and supplies but I have never purchased anything from them.
